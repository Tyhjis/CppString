These are the instructions to my own attempt at making a string class 
and writing automated tests for it.
You need g++ compiler. This project was tested on linux.
You can compile the project by running the "compile.sh" script. Keep the 
script in its original location. After compiling you can run the program
by writing ./mystringtest on the command line. You might have to change
execution rights for the script.
The program tests string input manually so in order to finish the program,
you will have to write something on the command line when the program
asks.
