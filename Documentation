Hello! This is my attempt at making my own c++ string class.
The class is called "mystring" and it has following features:

Author: Kristian Hansson
Constructors:
//examples
mystring str("Hello"); //literal constructor
mystring str(char *s); //takes char pointer
mystring str = "Hello"; //literal = constructor
mystring str(mystring str); //copy constructor
mystring str = mystring str; //copy = constructor

Input (>>) and output (<<)

mystring catenation (operator +):
mystring str = "Hello";
str = str + "World"; // Now str has the value "HelloWorld"
mystring str2 = "AndUniverse";
str = str + str2; // Now str has the value "HelloWorldAndUniverse"

Substring:
mystring subString():
//examples
mystring str = "Hello";
str = str.subString(2); // Now str has the value "llo"

push_back(char c)

char Access ([] operator) (int index)
Returns the character at the given index. Throws exception if index is out of bounds.

mystring replace(int index, char c) 
Returns a new mystring with replaced character at given index. Throws exception if index is out of bounds.

int getLength()
Returns the length of the string.

Swap:
Swaps the contents of two mystring objects.

All the features are tested automatically except for the input and output operators.
Tests are simple assertions. Using assert.h.

Issues:
The mystring class destructor does not delete the char *str which contains the string.
I tried different ways of somehow destroying it, but didn't have enough time.

Access and modify ([] =) feature is not implemented. Replace method implemented instead.
Iterators are not implemented as well. (Forgot)
